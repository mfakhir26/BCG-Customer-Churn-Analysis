# BCG-Customer-Churn-Analysis
Customer churn analysis and predictive modeling project from the BCG Data Analytics Virtual Experience

I completed BCG's Data Science on Forage. In the simulation I:
 - Completed a customer churn analysis simulation for BCG Analytics, demonstrating advanced data analytics skills, identifying essential client data and outlining a strategic investigation approach.
- Conducted efficient data analysis using Python, including Pandas and NumPy. Employed data visualization techniques for insightful trend interpretation.
- Completed the engineering and optimization of a random forest model, achieving an 85% accuracy rate in predicting customer churn.
- Completed a concise executive summary for the Associate Director, delivering actionable insights for informed decision-making based on the analysis.

Here‚Äôs a **professional and detailed long description** that you can use in your GitHub `README.md`, LinkedIn post, or even a project section on your resume or portfolio site.

During the **BCG Data Analytics Virtual Experience Program** offered via Forage, I worked on a real-world business scenario centered around **customer churn analysis** for a telecommunications company. The objective was to identify customers at risk of churning and develop a predictive model to help the business reduce churn rates and improve retention strategies.

### üîç Project Overview

The project was divided into three major phases:

---

### 1. **Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Data Visualization**

* Analyzed customer demographics, service usage patterns, and churn rates using `pandas`, `matplotlib`, and `seaborn`.
* Identified key variables correlated with churn such as yearly consumption, monthly charges, contract type, and payment method.
* Created visualizations (bar plots, histograms, box plots) to uncover trends and patterns in churn behavior.
* Gained insights into business implications through descriptive statistics and data segmentation.

---

### 2. **Feature Engineering**

* Handled missing data and encoded categorical variables using techniques like one-hot encoding and label encoding.
* Engineered new features by using the existing ones.
* Transformed some features with the high-skew distributions to make the distibution approximately normal to have better accuracy of the model
* Prepared a clean, model-ready dataset by splitting into training and testing sets using `scikit-learn`.

---

### 3. Model Training and Evaluation
Built and evaluated a Random Forest classifier to predict customer churn.

Chose Random Forest for its robustness, ability to handle both numerical and categorical variables, and built-in feature importance metrics.

Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, F1-score, and ROC-AUC.

Interpreted the results to identify the most influential factors contributing to churn.

## ‚úÖ Key Learnings

* Developed a structured, end-to-end workflow for solving real business problems using data.
* Strengthened skills in **data preprocessing, feature engineering, and machine learning** with Python.
* Improved my ability to communicate data insights visually and narratively for stakeholders.
* Gained experience working on a project simulating the role of a data analyst at **Boston Consulting Group (BCG)**.
* Learned how to balance model accuracy with business interpretability.
